			<td class="post_text"><!--human interaction beginning -->
			<p class="question">[you&rsquo;re the second person I ever interviewed so I&rsquo;m not really good at this yet]</p>

			<p class="answer">Oh that&rsquo;s fine</p>
			<!--time they wake up-->

			<p class="question">[what time do you usually wake up for work?]</p>

			<p class="answer">Lemme see&hellip; usually 8:30 - nine o&rsquo;clock</p>
			<!--what they have for breakfast-->

			<p class="question">[what foods do you enjoy for breakfast]</p>

			<p class="answer">I will usually do Cheerios, a cold cereal, like Total. Something really healthy and I would take multivitamins and supplements</p>
			<!--any quirky morning rituals-->

			<p class="question">[any morning rituals before you head to the studio?]</p>

			<p class="answer">If it&rsquo;s the studio, I don&rsquo;t have too much leisurely time in the morning but if I&#39;m working at my apartment, I usually like to go to Starbucks or Barnes and Noble and read my Bible for about half an hour to an hour</p>

			<p class="answer">It helps put things in perspective, knowing God is in control of everything so your successes won&rsquo;t get to your head and your screwups won&rsquo;t crush you. It helps put the right scale on things</p>

			<p></p>
			<!--anything else they like to do besides their craft?-->

			<p class="question">[what do you look forward to throughout the day or throughout the week?]</p>

			<p class="answer">Personal time to draw my own stuff cause it&rsquo;s the &quot;release.&quot; Especially after a job... it&#39;s very cut and dry and they just kinda tell you what they want and there&rsquo;s no creative or no artistic license</p>

			<p class="answer">Like this is the release. This is the inside of my mind. It&#39;s like a circus you know and if it doesn&rsquo;t get out it kinda puts me in a crabby mood when I don&rsquo;t draw freely</p>

			<p></p>

			<p class="question">[how often do you draw a day or every week?]</p>

			<p class="answer">Probably 6 hours at work and then maybe an hour or two every other day. So probably looking at about <i>50 hours a week an average</i></p>
			<!-- their inspriations-->

			<p class="question">[is there anything you do as an artist or even just as person that helps you with your artwork]</p>

			<p class="answer">Chuck Jones. He&rsquo;s a super famous animator, he did Tom and Jerry, Bugs Bunny and in this old interview he said that one of the best things to expand your visual vocabulary is to be funnier and to <em>just read</em></p>

			<p class="answer">Read a lot of books. Read anything. It doesn&rsquo;t matter science, fiction, so I try to open myself to not only just reading different kinds of books and graphic novels,but I watch lots of different TV shows, movies, video games that expose myself to a lot of information all the time</p>

			<p></p>
			<!--their current project or what they&rsquo;re famous for or their passion specifically, a concrete example of something they produced-->

			<p class="question">[Starwars x Disney Princesses is probably your biggest hit on Deviant Art. It even appeared in places that you didn&rsquo;t give it permission to. What was your first reaction to that type of popularity?]</p>

			<p class="answer">You&rsquo;re excited. Like...</p>

			<p class="answer">&quot;Wow, I finially hit a vein in the public.&quot;</p>

			<p class="answer">Cause an artist craves the accolades of other people to some degree.</p>

			<p class="answer">You would never want to put something or make something and have no one see it. You do want some people to see it, but in this degree.</p>

			<p class="answer">I was like...</p>

			<p class="answer">&quot;Yeah, I finally hit a vein,&quot;</p>

			<p class="answer">But then I was like...</p>

			<p class="answer">Oh my gosh, what&rsquo;s gonna happen? Are people going to start talking crap? Are they gonna start saying he&rsquo;s a no-hack?&quot;</p>

			<p class="answer">Or they start puting their own spin on what they think my intentions are but it was overwhelmingly positive but 95% positive comments</p>

			<p></p>

			<p class="question">[what do you wish non-artists understood about artists?]</p>

			<p class="answer">It always sucks when a person doesn&rsquo;t have a passion in their life...&nbsp;of any kind</p>

			<p class="answer">It doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be a hobbie or a craft, whether it&#39;s your family or a son or a wife. If there&rsquo;s something that you don&rsquo;t really love or cherish, it&rsquo;s hard to explain why I do what I do</p>

			<p class="answer">People who are too practical and too pragmatic are just...you won&rsquo;t get to them... and I feel that way</p>

			<p class="answer">It&rsquo;s important to have passion in what you like</p>

			<p class="answer">Without passion, it&rsquo;s like</p>

			<p class="answer"><i>what are you doing it for? </i></p>

			<p class="answer">You have to love it. You always get good at the things that you love</p>

			<p></p>

			<p class="question">[what&rsquo;s one thing everyone should try to incorporate into their lifestyle? One thing everyone should try to do everyday or something should make a habit]</p>

			<p class="answer">Train yourself to&hellip; you ever notice when you say &ldquo;okay I&rsquo;m gonna go exercise&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go read 10 pages of this book&rdquo; you get home and there&rsquo;s that <i>resistence</i>...</p>

			<p class="answer">You&rsquo;re like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like doing it.&rdquo; Training yourself to fight that resistence becomes beneficial cause once it becomes habitual then that resistence is no longer there</p>

			<p class="question">[anything else you&rsquo;d like to share? For inspiring artists?]</p>

			<p class="answer">A lot of people ask what are my secrets to being a good artists, cause that&rsquo;s always a big question</p>

			<p class="answer">But there is no substitute for hard work</p>

			<p class="answer">You just have to draw all the time, that&rsquo;s really it</p>

			<p class="answer">Just draw</p>

			<p class="answer">draw</p>

			<p class="answer">draw...</p>

			<p class="answer">Just draw all the time.</p>

    <!--SPOTLIGHT-->

    <!--human interaction beginning -->
      <p>[you&rsquo;re the second person I ever interviewed so I&rsquo;m not really good at this yet]</p>

      <p>Oh that&rsquo;s fine</p>
      <!--time they wake up-->

      <p>[what time do you usually wake up for work?]</p>

      <p>Lemme see&hellip; usually 8:30 - nine o&rsquo;clock</p>
      <!--what they have for breakfast-->

      <p>[what foods do you enjoy for breakfast]</p>

      <p>I will usually do Cheerios, a cold cereal, like Total. Something really healthy and I would take multivitamins and supplements</p>
      <!--any quirky morning rituals-->

      <p>[any morning rituals before you head to the studio?]</p>

      <p>If it&rsquo;s the studio, I don&rsquo;t have too much leisurely time in the morning but if I&#39;m working at my apartment, I usually like to go to Starbucks or Barnes and Noble and read my Bible for about half an hour to an hour</p>

      <p>It helps put things in perspective, knowing God is in control of everything so your successes won&rsquo;t get to your head and your screwups won&rsquo;t crush you. It helps put the right scale on things</p>

      <p></p>
      <!--anything else they like to do besides their craft?-->

      <p>[what do you look forward to throughout the day or throughout the week?]</p>

      <p>Personal time to draw my own stuff cause it&rsquo;s the &quot;release.&quot; Especially after a job... it&#39;s very cut and dry and they just kinda tell you what they want and there&rsquo;s no creative or no artistic license</p>

      <p>Like this is the release. This is the inside of my mind. It&#39;s like a circus you know and if it doesn&rsquo;t get out it kinda puts me in a crabby mood when I don&rsquo;t draw freely</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>[how often do you draw a day or every week?]</p>

      <p>Probably 6 hours at work and then maybe an hour or two every other day. So probably looking at about <i>50 hours a week an average</i></p>

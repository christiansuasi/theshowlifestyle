		<p>Welcome.</p>

		<p>

			you’re the second person I ever interviewed so i’m not really good at this yet

			oh that’s fine.

			what time do you usually wake up for work?

			lemme see… usually eight thirty, nine o’clock.

			what foods do you enjoy for breakfast

			i will usually do cheerios, a cold cereal, like total. something really healthy and i would take multivitamins and supplements

			any morning rituals before you head to the studio?

			if it’s the studio, i don’t have too much leisurely time in the morning but if i’m working at my apartment, i usually like to go to starbucks or barnes and noble and read my bible for about half an hour to an hour cause it helps put things in perspecitive, knowing God is in control of everything so your successes won’t get to your head and your screwups won’t crush you. cause you know it helps put the right scale on things

			what do you look forward to throughout the day or throughout the week?

			personal time to draw my own stuff cause it’s the release you know especially after you know like a job is very cut and dry and they just kinda tell you what they want and there’s no creative or no artistic license like this is like the release this is like the inside of my mind is like a circus you know and if it’s if it doesn’t get out it kinda puts me in a crabby mood when I don’t draw freely.

			how often do you draw a day or every week

			probably 6 hours at work and then maybe an hour or two every other day personal stuff so probably looking at about 50 hours a week an average

			is there anything you do as an artist or even just as person that helps you with your artwork

			chuck jones. he’s a super famous animator, he did tom and jerry and bugs bunny and in this old interview he said that one of the best things to expand your visual vocabulary and being able to be funnier and better timing is just read. read a lot of books. read anything. it doesn’t matter science, fiction, so i try to open myself to not only just reading different kidns of books and graphic novels, i watch lots of different tv shows movies video games like i expose myself to a lot of information all the time

			starwars x disney princess is probably your biggest hit in devart, so much that your artwork appeared in places thaty ou didn’t give it permission to, what was your first reaction to that type of popuarlity

			you’re excited like wow i finially hit a vein in the public cause that’s always like an artist craves the accolades of other people to some degree like you would never want to put something or make something and have no one see it, you do want some people to see it but in this degree, i was like yeah i finally hit a vein but then i was like omg what’s gonna happen are people going to start talking crap? are they gonna start saying he’s a no-hack or they start puting their own spin on what they think my intentions are but it was overwhelmingly positive but 95% positive comments. 

			what do you wish non-artists understood about artists?

			it always sucks when a person doesn’t have a passion in their life. of any kind. it doesn’t necessarily have to be a hobbie or a craft, whether its like your family or a son or a wife, if there’s something that you don’t really love or cherish it’s hard to explain why i do what i do. people who are too practical and too pragmatic are just like like you won’t get to them i feel that way. 

			it’s important to have passion in what you like/

			without passion, it’s like what are you doing it for? you have to love it. you always get good at the things that you love.

			i like that a lot

			would you like to share what you’re working on next or give a hint?

			as far a personal work, expect lots of cool fan art, batman, trying to come up with new crossovers, superhero stuff and new cross overs and uh professional work? no comment.

			on non related work stuff now, what’s wrong thing you wish you had more time for?

			oh man. more time for other people, spending more time with them doing things for them enjoying their company and so forth, 

			anything that you’re grateful for? could be as cliche as possible doesn’t matter

			i know i’m blessed with an unsual life so there’s always that provision that God provides, obviously Mom and Dad pretty much.

			what’s one thing everyone should try to incorporate into their lifestyle? one thing everyone should try to do everyday or something should make a habit

			train yourself to… you ever notice when you say “okay i’m gonna go exercise” or “i’m gonna go read 10 pages of this book” you get home and there’s that resistence. you’re like “i don’t feel like doing it” training yourself to fight that resistence becomes beneficial cause once it becomes habitual then that resistence is no longer there. 

			unfortunately i’ve trained myself to be that way when i get sleepy, like i’ve taught mysel how to fight sleep

			i’m pretty sure a lot of pokek ahve


			it’s liek the worse thing to teach yoruself, it’s been helpful in the past but ugh i wish i didn’t teach myself that

			wrapping up. 

			influences you look up for arists,

			i go through periods in my life like when i was a kid i would draw those silly little how to draw 50 animals or how to draw 50 monsters but once i get to middle school and i got real training, i started to look at cominc books like holy crap this is what you can do with anatomy and this is what you can do with color so a lot of comic book artist is what really launched me into wanting to pursue what i do and the rensassince masters its like a mixture of classic and modern cause the leonardo and their information is valuabie it’s timeless you can always apply it to anything, i like a lot of the classic animators espseically the old, there’s a legendary part of disney history that when walt disney started the comapny he didn;t have any artists and he picked these guys that are now known as the 9 old men. it’s kinda funny, it’s like the 9 old men are the most respected animators of all time, they’re all dead now but they’re stuff is breathtaking and timeless and like those are our renaissance masters so a lot of comic book and a lot of animation with a mixture of the great, the old rensassince masters 

			anything else you’d like to share

			something that that’d be good to share? a lot of people ask what are my secrest to being a good artists, cause that’s always a big question. but there is no substitute for hard work, you just have to draw all the time, that’s really it. just draw draw draw… just draw all the time.

			any other advice for our readers who culd be aspiring artists?

			just draw all the time and don’t get discouraged
